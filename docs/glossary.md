# Glossary

## Quick Lookup

Common terms used in this module:

- **Signal** - a derived metric created from raw data
- **Raw Metric** - a directly recorded measurement from a system
- **Derived Metric** - a value calculated from one or more raw metrics
- **Error Rate** - proportion of errors relative to total requests
- **Latency** - the time required for a system to respond to a request
- **Throughput** - the volume of work processed by a system (for example, number of requests)

## Raw Metric

A measurement recorded directly from a system. Examples:

- number of requests
- number of errors
- total latency

Raw metrics describe what happened but may not be the easiest values to interpret.

## Signal

A **signal** is a **derived metric** designed to make system behavior easier to understand.
Signals are usually created by combining or transforming raw metrics.
Examples:

- error rate
- average latency per request
- throughput

Signals help analysts monitor system health and detect unusual behavior.

### Error Rate

The proportion of failed requests relative to total requests.
This signal helps identify **reliability problems** in a system.

```
error_rate = errors / requests
```

### Latency

The **time required** for a system to respond to a request.
In this module, we often compute **average latency per request**:

```
avg_latency = total_latency_ms / requests
```

### Throughput

The **amount of work processed** by a system in a given observation period.
Examples include:

- requests handled
- transactions processed
- messages delivered

## Feature Engineering

The process of creating new variables (features or signals) from existing data.
**Signal design is a form of feature engineering** for monitoring systems.
Feature engineering often includes:

- ratios (errors / requests)
- averages (latency per request)
- aggregations (rolling means)
- transformations (log, scaling, normalization)

## Signal Design

The process of creating useful signals from raw system metrics.
Well-designed signals make system behavior easier to monitor and interpret, which is essential for **continuous intelligence systems**.
